I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nThe response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. \\nI wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. \\n\\nTrans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. \\n\\nPlease investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because XXXX, XXXX and Trans union all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I. I demand that these items on my account that was not verified be removed from my account because they are in violation of my rights and not to mention, Trans union did not even respond to my investigation request.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'This complaint dates back to last XX/XX/XXXX during a loan modification which was done with XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) my previous loan servicer this was after a 2 month forbearance after Hurricane Irma. They had indicated a shortage to my escrow account in the loan modification documents. I was provided different information every time I spoke on the phone with a XXXX   representative. One would say I had an overage, others would say I had a shortage. The modification documents indicated at {$1900.00} shortage. I called, I emailed and wrote letters, I requested a Escrow review of my account in XXXX and XXXX and was told one would be done. They kept delaying and I finally had to sign the Modification documents on XX/XX/XXXX under duress otherwise the Modification would be withdrawn. No review of my escrow was ever done by XXXX, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. The Escrow balance for XX/XX/XXXX shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a XXXX actual balance for XXXX, a difference of XXXX when only XXXX should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to XXXX and they have not responded. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # XXXX ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of XXXX in my account. Even though my account is currently at a XXXX deficit as of XX/XX/XXXX. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was XXXX last year ( when it was actually XXXX ) and this year the correct amount of XXXX. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at XXXX ( the actual was XXXX ) and listed this year the correct amount at XXXX so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of XXXX increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in XXXX so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. My taxes did go up from XXXX to XXXX, so the net effect of the two is only XXXX. I am already paying one shortage based on XXXX miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years. \\nI want both XXXX and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have XXXX send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste. I want Mr Cooper to revise the shortage based on all of this information. \\nContact Information : XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX Phone XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, Tx.

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'We have already tried to contact the company with the following complaint 3 times using different avenues. In the most recent email sent, we requested that they contact us to at least acknowledge that the complaint was received. We have gotten no responses since the complaint was first filed three weeks ago. The text of the submitted complaint follows. \\n\\nTo whom it may concern : We are writing to submit a formal complaint regarding the poor service that we received while working with XXXX XXXX XXXX/Closing Mark Home Loan. We are strongly considering submitting a formal complaint to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any similar state agency in Colorado and/or California, as we feel that there were instances that pushed the boundaries of acceptable and, possible, legal behavior. \\nThe entire loan process with this company, from start to finish, has been unprofessional at best to downright deceptive and, potentially, life-impacting. We have been forgotten, lied to, and put into stressful situations that, frankly, should never happen. We have been through multiple account officers and underwriters, been asked to submit documents multiple times, been told falsehoods, and, upon completing closing on XX/XX/XXXX, we received letters that appeared to be informing us that we had been denied for the loan that we closed on. \\nThe following is a summarized narrative of the timeline from starting the prequalification process to closing on the mortgage. This timeline has been compiled based upon timestamped communication ( both written and digital ). \\nWe started this journey in XX/XX/2019, upon starting the prequalification process. We submitted the requested information to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( herein after XXXX )  and promptly received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, we received an initial workbook which showed us the expected loan amount, down payment amount, fees, etc. The individual that we started with was extremely responsive and helpful, answering any of our questions promptly and clearly. \\nWe toured the community and decided that it was a good fit for us. At that time, we were given the option of looking for outside financing options or pursuing financing with the related company, XXXX ; the related financing came with builder incentives. At no point were we pressured by the sales team at XXXX to go with XXXX. However, as we had already started the prequalification process ( and the subsequent hard hit to our credit scores ) and because of the very good service we had received to date, as well as the healthy builder incentive, we signed the sales contract with the commitment to pursue the mortgage through XXXX. The contract was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, following a discussion with both the sales team at XXXX and the XXXX representative. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday ), we reached out to the XXXX representative to see what the next financing steps would be, as the sales team indicated that the mortgage company would reach out to us. The next day ( a Sunday ), the XXXX representative informed us that he would be running an automated approval and would reach out if he needed additional documents. We took this to mean that our application was complete enough to start the clock and was in process. At this point, we had not been told that additional documents would be required to complete our application, just that there may be a need for additional documentation. \\nWe did not hear back from the XXXX representative after that point. On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday, nearly two full calendar weeks from last contact ), we reached out to the XXXX representative again. By XX/XX/XXXX ( Wednesday ), we emailed the XXXX sales team for assistance ; they referred us to the president of the mortgage company. We were informed, by the president of the company, that the XXXX representative that had been handling our application had abruptly left XXXX and that our application had not been passed onto another case manager/loan officer. By that time, our required loan approval date had passed ; this date was stipulated in our sales contract. \\nWe were connected with a new XXXX representative ( herein after referred to as new XXXX representative or loan officer ) who informed us via email that our application was incomplete and that nothing had been processed in the intervening time. Again, we had been under the impression that our application was complete and in process since mid-XXXX. At that point, again, nearly two weeks had passed, and we did not receive a formal notification of incompleteness. \\nDuring the subsequent document collection period, the loan officer asked we could put down another half percent, which would increase our down payment to 3.5 % of the sales price. We agreed that we could afford the extra 0.5 %, but asked if she was considering an FHA loan. She informed us that she was looking at that option. At that point, we stated that we did not want to pursue an FHA loan, but said that we would consider it if we could see all the financing options that she could offer us. We asked that we be provided with a worksheet showing all the offerings that we could qualify for, so that we could pick the option that best matched our needs. We never received a product comparison worksheet despite the written request. Additionally, we did not receive an updated worksheet showing our expected costs at this time. \\n\\nSubsequently, as we were loading additional documents into the XXXX portal when we noticed that we had a loan details section available. We opened that section of the webpage and saw that our loan had been started under an FHA program, despite the fact that we had told our loan officer that we did not want an FHA loan and despite the fact that we had not been given a worksheet showing our product options. We communicated to the loan officer that we emphatically did not want the FHA loan, as the fees associated with the loan would negate any benefit from going with XXXX, based upon the builder incentives. Additionally, both of us have strong credit scores and did not need the credit support to qualify for a mortgage. Instead of giving us a workbook showing us our different financing options, the loan officer changed the product type for the mortgage to a XXXX  XXXX  conventional loan. Again, at no point were we allowed to select our product type ( or informed that XXXX only offered a limited product selection ). We were not given the information needed to make an informed decision. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received the first set of loan disclosure documents ; we were not talked through our product choices at this point. We promptly signed the loan disclosures, after saving a copy and reviewing in detail. At this point, we received our first estimate ( aside from the prequalification estimate provided in XXXX ) that showed our expected loan costs, rate, fees, etc. This information was not provided ahead of time and we were informed that we had only 72 hours to sign the documents. We were not given options on product type or any other factor. Additionally, we were not offered any assistance in understanding the documents that we were given or any help working through the legalese. \\n\\nIt should be noted that we were informed, only by the disclosures, that the PMI would not be cancellable due to rising home values. At the outset, the original XXXX  representative implied ( though, notably, did not explicitly state ), that the home could be reappraised after a period of time and the new value used for the LTV calculation. Under the subsequent disclosures, it was apparent that the PMI could only cancellable via loan payments compared to the original appraised value at closing. While not a major issue, it is notable because it is contradictory to information that we had at outset. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received an automated email informing us that we had updated disclosures to sign. The email did not indicate what the changes were, nor did the loan officer notify us at any point that changes had been made. Upon reviewing the disclosures, the changes were the addition of a TILA form ( that we did not receive in our original packet ), an additional {$200.00} fee, and the removal of our {$5000.00} earnest money deposit. As a result, our updated disclosures indicated that we would owe an additional {$5000.00} in cash for our down payment at closing.\\n\\nWe reached out the same date to the loan officer and received a response that equated to her not knowing what was going on. Upon further research, she informed us that she wasnt sure why the earnest money deposit was removed and that she would make sure that we would get updated documents showing the amount. We were told to be confident that the credit would be given at closing. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we were introduced via email to a loan processor ( herein after loan processor or underwriter ; this introduction came directly from the loan processor and the loan officer was not involved in the introduction. At this time, the loan processor stated that our loan was conditionally approved, dependent upon two document lists. One list was to be provided as soon as possible, while the other was due within 60 days of closing. At this point, we were at about a month and a half out from the point at which we had been originally led to believe that our application was complete.\\n\\nMany of the documents requested at this time had already been submitted as part of our original loan package or the subsequent package initiated by the loan officer. We had to resend many of the documents and enter them onto an online portal. \\n\\nIt should be noted, at this point, we sent images ( pictures ) of several of the documents to the loan processor. This was not an issue and she did not request that the documents be scanned or otherwise in a different format. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we began reaching out to the loan officer to get information for the mortgagee clause, as our insurance agent was requesting it before he could start the formal application and estimate process on his side. The next day, we were informed that a new loan processor ( different from the current underwriter ) would provide that information to our agent. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we reached out to the loan processor, as we had not heard from her since we submitted our documents ( largely completed in XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, she responded and said that she received all our documents that that everything looks good at this time. She said that she would reach out closer to closing, but did not state why. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the loan officer informing us that XXXX had acquired Closing Mark Home Loans ( herein after CMHL ) and that our mortgage application would be acquired by CMHL. The email stated that our mortgage would be redisclosed and that we would need to sign updated disclosures. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received a notification from CMHL stating that the XXXX mortgage application had been migrated to the new platform. We received new loan disclosures at that time. \\n\\nThe XX/XX/XXXX letter informed us that we would be receiving an updated conditional approval. This is a month after we had originally been conditionally approved. The loan officer did not reach out to explain that a new application had been started on the new platform, hence the approval process was started over entirely. The document informed us that our application was started XX/XX/XXXX, though it was not explicitly made clear that it was a completely new loan application and not just a formality due to the new system. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received the formal scheduling request for closing, via Closing Mark Settlement Services. While this was scheduled, we had not yet received a formal approval, final disclosures, or closing instructions. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received 3 options for the interest rate lock. The option sheet was sent only with instructions to look at Options 1, 2 and 3, with no explanation for the calculations, differences, or any other factors. Upon reviewing them, the only option that we could follow the math on was Option 3. Given the previous difficulties in obtaining information from the loan officer, we decided to lock on the option that we could follow. Based on our math, the other two options did not appear to conform to standard amortization at the listed interest rates, but, again, we could not follow the math. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received our updated disclosures for the interest rate lock. This disclosure, like previous disclosures, did not have any charge for points. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the president of the mortgage company. This email informed us that XXXX was legally required to close out the application and that we would soon be receiving a notice from XXXX  that would show that XXXX  no longer had an active application in the system for us ; the email stated that the communication that we would receive could include language stated that the application was denied, but that it would not impact our ongoing application with CMHL. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received a Changed Circumstance letter. This letter added a {$770.00} fee, amounting to 0.25 % of the loan amount, as points, as part of the origination costs. This fee was not explained to us. The letter stated that it was due to the credit report/credit score and credit report/mortgage insurance. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email titled XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Conditional Loan Approval. This email included a list of new documents to provide, including new disclosures, new bank statements, new paystubs, insurance quote, and college transcripts. It should be noted that we were told, in the body of the email, that the documents needed to be provided asap. At this point, we were not offered a secure way to send our documents. We could email them back to the loan processor directly or fax them. \\n\\nAt this point, we were also informed that we could not send pictures of documents to the loan processor, despite having been able to send images previously. While navigable, this put a fair amount of undue pressure on us, as we had to find a way to scan our documents to be able to send them via email. We also found that we had a significant amount of pressure from the loan processor to provide the documents quickly On XX/XX/XXXX, we received disclosures to sign. On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed the loan officer and asked if the disclosures were the final set and if the listed cash to close amount was the amount we needed to get our cashiers check for closing. We were informed that the disclosures given were the final set. \\n\\nThe XX/XX/XXXX documents additionally included a waiver for the receipt of the appraisal within the timing required by ECOA section 1002.14 ( a ) ( 1 ). \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we received the appraisal on the property. This property appraisal had been completed on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed our loan officer to ask about what name to put on the cashiers check for closing, as we never received closing instructions. While this email was sent on a Saturday, we had previously received prompt responses from all parties, even on weekends. We had no reason to believe that we would not hear back prior to closing on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWe received no further communication from the mortgage company, nor any of its agents, prior to closing. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, we closed on the mortgage. Our appointment to close was at XXXX. We arrived at approximately XXXX, as our previous meeting for the day had ended more quickly than expected. We were prepared to wait until XXXX. Our closing agent came out at around XXXX and told us that our application had not yet been approved by CMHL and that she was, as a result, still, waiting for documents. She also informed us that she had not yet received the final closing disclosure and that, as a result, our cash to close amount had not yet ben finalized. \\n\\nAt about XXXX, our closing agent informed us that she had received several closing disclosures for our application that day. She then stated that the final closing amount had been set by CMHL, as she had confirmed the most recent disclosure with the wire processor. We were short on our original check ( which was stated as the final amount, as previously noted ) and were forced to go back to our bank. We had to come up with about {$800.00} on the spot to be able to close. At this point, our closing documents were not yet available. \\n\\nWe signed our documents at our XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. We waited at the settlement office until nearly XXXX XXXX for the final wire to be sent by the processing agent. We were given no explanation for the significant wait. \\n\\nAfter closing, we returned to our then-current residence for the night. We checked our mail. We found two letters which were mailed to us ( one for each of us ), which stated that our loan had been denied. The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, but had not been mailed and post-marked until XX/XX/XXXX. These letters were related to the hand-off from XXXX to CMHL. As previously noted, we had been told in XXXX that we may receive a formal denial letter, due to the new application being opened. As given by the discrepancy between the letter and postmark dates, it appears that these letters were held back for some reason. The reason was not given to us at any point in the application process. \\n\\nThe following day, XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from our loan officer apologizing for the delay in response to our question regarding our closing and a statement that she hoped our closing went okay. No comments were included regarding the fact that our loan had not been approved for the day of closing. We did not respond. \\n\\nIn summary, the entire process was fraught and full of miscommunications and a lack of communication. Our grievances are summarized below : Our application was forgotten by the mortgage company, as the original representative left and nobody picked up his caseload. \\nOur application was implied to have been complete and in process with the original representative. \\no At no point did we receive a formal notice of incompleteness, despite ongoing requests for information over several months. \\no We were not given a complete checklist of all the information that we would need to provide throughout the life of the application and approval process. \\nWe were not given product comparisons between available options, despite multiple requests for such information. \\nWe were originally put into a product type that we explicitly stated that we did not want. \\no While we do not know the details of the XXXX/CMHL compensation structure, we have been informed by multiple individuals from outside financial institutions that FHA loans often generate a larger incentive fee for the loan officer. We believe that this could be the reason for the initial assignment.\\n\\nWe were given contradictory information throughout the process. This includes receiving documents which did not include {$5000.00} in cash we had already paid ; while this was resolved, this issue was never explained to us.\\n\\nWe were not given explanations for multiple adjustments and changes to fees and amounts through out the process.\\n\\no Our loan officer did not make any attempt to explain any of the forms, procedures, or documents that we received. We were forced to make our best attempt at understanding the files that we had to sign. \\no When setting our rate lock, the loan officer did not explain the difference between the given options. As previously stated, two of the options did not mathematically calculate to the payments given.\\n\\no We are better informed than most consumers, as one of us works for a commercial bank. Even then, we had trouble with some of the documents and it is baffling that we received no guidance from the loan officer.\\n\\nWe were denied a secure way to send documents to the loan processor.\\n\\no Additionally, a format which had previously been acceptable for files, was no longer acceptable. We were not given an explanation for this discrepancy. \\nWe were not given closing instructions. When we reached out for instructions ( admitted at the 11th hour ), we did not receive a response. This is out of line with prior behavior, as we had previously received prompt communication even outside of normal business hours. \\no The response from the lender was given a business day after our closing. It should be noted that this response did not include any of the requested information. \\nOur loan was not approved prior to the day of our closing and, in actuality, we had to wait for the application to be approved and for documents to be prepared and sent to our closing agent. \\no While we are not sure of the industry standard for loan approvals and preparation of loan documents for mortgages, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the process should be completed well prior to the day of closing. \\no This caused a significant amount of personal stress, as our closing agent could not give us an expected timeline. We were left unaware of if we were going to be able to close on our scheduled date or if we would need to be rescheduled. \\nThis is significant, as we had already made arrangements for our moving process, including cancelling our lease with our prior residence, booking and prepaying for moving equipment, and taking time off from work ( including taking time for the day of closing itself ). \\nWe received a formal loan denial after our closing, with the denial letters being sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Given that XX/XX/XXXX was a holiday, it seems likely that the letters were sent so as to not be received until after closing. \\no The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, which means that the letters were held back for well over a month. While we are not sure on the required disclosure timelines for consumer loans, we have been informed that it is often 10 days from the decision date. This delivery falls well outside of that window.',\n",

I received my first notice from Commonwealth Financial Systems on or around XX/XX/2019. The letter is dated XX/XX/2019. The letter states that I have 30 days to dispute the debt and if they do not hear from me within that time, then the debt is considered valid. Well, they reported it to my credit report on XX/XX/2019 without ever giving me 30 days to dispute the debt. They have reported debt to my credit report that they have not validated. I called their office and spoke to the supervisor XXXX XXXX, and she said they report it to the credit bureau within 30 days from the time they receive the debt. This is their standard practice. She said they received the debt XX/XX/2019. I would have no way of knowing this without them mailing me a notice, which they did not bother to send until XX/XX/2019. They are reporting debt that they have stated they do not even know if it's valid. I do not even know what this debt is. She said she would remove it from my credit report for the next 30-45 days as they are working on validating the debt. They are only supposed to be reporting the debt after the consumer has been given written notice and a chance to dispute the debt. The fact that this is their standard business practice is appalling. Please look into this company. Thank you,XXXX  XXXX\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs \\'\\', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. \\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. \\n\\n\\n1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. \\n\\n\\n2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. \\n\\n\\n3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. \\n\\n\\n4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. \\n\\n\\n5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. \\n\\n\\n6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..',\n",

Last year my mortgage was sold from XXXX XXXX  ( Under mortgage # XXXX ) to Ditech Mortgage ( account # XXXX ). I reached out to Ditech via a email ( after being told to do so via phone representative ) request to remove my PMI on mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and received no response at all from them, I even checked my junk box and nothing was there. My mortgage papers that I signed state an \" Automatic Termination of PMI \\'\\' that states once my loan is below 78 % loan to value PMI will automatically terminate ( I have attached this document ). I reached out again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make this request via phone and was told initially to send the request that I already sent it too. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold for about 30 minutes, I finally spoke to one. They told me that my loan to value must be under 70 % loan to value and that was their policy. After reading this document to the supervisor, I was told that \" they don\\'t have that document on file \\'\\'. She ( XXXX XXXX ) sent me a link to send her the form I have. I did so and just told me that I\\'ll be hearing from them in 7-10 business days. Given their past history, I highly doubt that I will hear from them. I did mention to the supervisor and ask her why they weren\\'t staying compliant to the homeowners protection act and she said nothing. From my understand this act requires mortgage companies to drop off PMI once loans are below 78 % LTV and the loan is current. I qualify for both of those items and don\\'t understand why this is such a difficult task.',\n",

It should be noted it was only on XXXX. We contacted XXXX & Wells Fargo bank to report the fraudulent accounts. They did confirm it was my SS # on file but with someone elses name, DOB, and address. We filled out fraud forms, send police report number, and copies of credit reports. On XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I received letters from both Wells Fargo & XXXX stating it was discovered to be identity theft and they would have the 3 credit bureaus remove from my credit file. I also placed a freeze on my credit files. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received a few voicemails from SS office stating my identity may have been compromised yet again. I pulled credit reports again and was shocked to see XXXX  is reporting my file as XXXX XXXX XXXX, his DOB, Addresses, XXXX XXXX is running inquiries ( I dont have ), Wells Fargo credit card is showing closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, last payment XX/XX/XXXX, shows consumer disputes, and last reported XX/XX/XXXX. None of this is mine and was to be removed. \\n\\nThis person is clearly using my SS # according to XXXX & Wells Fargo. XXXX did their job and removed it for Fraud. Wells Fargo has not. How did a large national bank such as Wells Fargo allow someone to open a credit card in my name without the proper verification. Clearly the other persons name and DOB ( XX/XX/XXXX ) does not match my SS #. Where is the verification on that? They allowed someone to use falsified documents and did not follow verification procedures. I am only XXXX yrs old and have been a victim of identity theft by 2 large companies.

The email read The final pay off amount for XXXX, XXXX will be {$86000.00} This information is provided by XXXX XXXX on XXXX. It was emailed from XXXX. The subject line read Re : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Payoff amount for XXXX and insurance info.The insurance info was a single page showing coverage of {$77000.00} on a single story dwelling from a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX listing my home address and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , as registered agent. XXXX XXXX was the insured. I responded to that email disagreeing with the amount and asked for some sort of statement of accounting because XXXX XXXX was asking for more than the {$85000.00} financed and I had made payments for 5 years and 7 months consecutively. She responded with just saying no she was correct. On or around XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney In Fact for a XXXX XXXX mailed me a Notice of substitute trustee sale The notice had a sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX A date of XX/XX/XXXX An amount of {$95000.00} Borrower XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Collateral : All of Debtors interest in the real property legal described as : XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX according to the map and plat there of recorded in the Deed Anns Plat Records XXXX County , Texas . The Note section is blank. This is dated XX/XX/XXXX and has a file stamp of XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX County Records. XXXX XXXX never lended me any money. I was the only person providing money in the purchase of my home. I was in a TREC   contract with XXXX XXXX for my home. It was already signed by us both for the home {$85000.00} financed for 360 months no balloon payment ; until I received XX/XX/XXXX closing documents showing a balloon payment due XXXX XXXX, payments of {$850.00} every month/ {$600.00} being the house payment and the other being taxes. I am wanting to see the bank statements and escrow accounting for the time period of XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX, XXXX and the payment records for taxes, and all transfer records. And the proof that XXXX XXXX has showing {$95000.00} going from her hand to mine. I want to see the substitute trustee recorded appointment and I want to see proof of XXXX XXXX identity. I want to see the accounting for the down payment made on the property and proof she owned the property when she sold it to me. \\nWhen I obtained legal representation and stopped the sale date, another debt collection letter came dated XX/XX/XXXX for a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. This notice contains all the same information as the previous notice except it is listing XXXX XXXX name first above XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney in fact at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX , Texas . After firing the first attorney hired after the discovery of {$21000.00} in receipts missing from my receipts of payments to XXXX XXXX a new hired attorney chose to conspire with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and in the printed emails left in my file that were my attorney and XXXX XXXX Attorney planning and executing the sale of my home they had agreed on the figures that XXXX will have the HUD 1 payoff Mr Cooper and XXXX loans paid in full their ( your, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) further states there is a first and second on this property Mr Cooper total payoff by XXXX XXXX {$47000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX payoff is {$13000.00} subtotal {$60000.00} BUT again there is language of a loan between XXXX and I in an amount said to be {$78000.00} and Mr. XXXX took the liberty of adding Attorney fees of {$5000.00} making a total of {$83000.00} these documents were emailed back and forth plan discussed of running it through the uncontested docket, signed by a judge, filed in the court records, being fully executed. But I never received any documentation of this sale. I am requesting / demanding the pay off accounting and statements and a copy of the HUD1.\\n\\nNow I am needing to have the documentation and explanation of how my home was sold, if it wasnt is it fraud on the court? And AGAIN I receive another notice of substitute trustee sale dated XX/XX/XXXX this time the amounts are base amount due as maturity : {$88000.00} / unpaid principle past maturity ( 18 % ) {$34000.00} / subtotal {$120000.00} / Attorney Fees XXXX / Cost {$120.00} / Total due XX/XX/XXXX {$130000.00} It continues to read : please contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for current payoff instructions at my address above please be advised if this payment is not received by XXXX the mortgagee will exercise the rights under the loan documents and foreclose the loan at public sale, Tuesday, XXXX, XXXX at XXXX. In accordance with the federal and Texas laws regarding fair debt debt collections unless you within thirty days after receipt of this notice, dispute the validity of the debt set forth above or any portionhereof the indebtedness will be assumed to be valid. This notice is signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney for XXXX XXXX. Now I want to know how you, XXXX XXXX XXXX or and XXXX XXXX can act as an Attorney in fact and harass me for months, years inducing lawsuits when an attorney in fact is not allowed to handle assets held in trust? How can you impose a debt on me of {$130000.00} and state you will respond to my letter of validation when you did not. Mailing me copies of public record court papers and passed made up accounting graphs from your home computer is not accounting. I want to see the reasoning on how you decided I owed this last mentioned notice and the removal of trustee documents recorded. You stated in this debt collection letter you would reveal the original creaditor upon my request and you did not.I mailed to you by certified letter and I faxed you the same validation letter but you not XXXX XXXX responded until I received again a substitute trustee sale notice this time 2 in the same envelope? dated XX/XX/XXXX And XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating I owe {$130000.00} and contains debt collection language but you are threatening to sell my home ...., you already did once. On XX/XX/XXXX you sold my home to XXXX XXXX for a credit bid of {$88000.00}.? I want all tax certificates and the deed of trust back I want all XXXX XXXX XXXX accounting and I want copies of all the escrow account. I want copies of proof you owned my home when you sold it to me XXXX XXXX, XXXX. \\nI demand documented proof that you obtained a legal confessed judgement by me. I demand documentation of the mortgage loan you have repeatedly made demands for payment of and of the investment contract you are holding / have held me liable for that I am not a party that is the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Statue of Frauds was made to prevent the very thing you have been doing to me. See UCC at 2-201. You have made me an undisclosed third party to a loan modification ; to a contract I am not a party to. This is why you have never been able to show my payments going to a servicing company you are sending them as cash flow to the investors. You kept using the term mortgage in your debt collection letters but a note is a security as you know, this was undisclosed to me along with a disclaimer that was supposed to be in the credit application under Title 16 16 car 433.2 which says the buyer/seller takes it subject to all defenses and claims that the buyer could assert against any transferee or any buyer who buys it. But you Took it out of the loan application. So there is no holder in due course meaning you take it subject to my claims and defenses I am claiming recoupment under UCC 3-305 under UCC 3-306 I am encoring my proprietary and possession art and property interest in the note and its proceds. Also I am encoring my right to rescind the endorsement on the note. The rider XXXX XXXX made the wrap around deed of trust with modifies the conditions of payment and supplements and governs the promissory note. UCC 3-106 ( D ) it cant be negotiated instrument if it is subject or governed by extraneous documents outside the promissory note and you made it subject to an adjustable rate Ryder and a deed of trust. You can not collect an alleged debt on what you call a mortgage and sell someones property when it is not a note or a negotiable interest. It has a maturity longer than nine months making it a security. I am encoring my right to claim under UCC 3-306 the proceeds, rescuind the negotiation, and am claiming my possessionary and property right in the proceeds in the investment contract. I demand a quick response with my demands met as they are rightfully mine and more than owed to me.',\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX had switched servicers to XXXX XXXX. The original promissory note I have, shows my father as applicant # 1/borrower, my mother as applicant # 2/co-borrower, and myself as student. This loan originated in XX/XX/XXXX. My father and I share the same name and I feel that has added confusion. My father always made the payments on this loan, as well as, collected tax documents and deductions on this loan, as the borrower. In XX/XX/XXXX, my father passed away from XXXX. My mother contacted XXXX and she was told about loan forgiveness. She submitted my fathers death certificate and she waited 32 days for an answer. Unfortunately, they did not approve the loan for forgiveness. Instead, XXXX has switched me, from student, to borrower and my mother stays as co-borrower. How did I go from being a student on a promissory note, to now the sole borrower? I have called XXXX, and it has been unsuccessful. I have requested documents including the denial letter stating why the loan wasnt forgiven as a result of my father 's death, the promissory note they have on file, as well as the loan terms indicating that I am now legally responsible for this loan. I have had no success in retrieving these documents. I have been told that I am not entitled to these documents from XXXX and to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX for the promissory note. I was told by a XXXX representative that the promissory note they have on file is not legible and she couldnt confirm who was supposed to be borrower/co-borrower. I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, for a copy of the promissory note, by email. I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX that they do not have the promissory note and to refer to XXXX copy. I have responded to their initial email, requesting more information and they have not responded. There is no contact information for XXXX XXXX XXXX, just an email address. I am doubtful of the information I have been given. I feel I should be entitled to a copy of the denial letter, as well as a legible copy of the promissory note. I would also like to see a copy of the loan terms indicating how I went from being a student, to now the main borrower. I want documentation, and feel it is my consumer right, to have proof that XXXX has that ability to change borrowers and to choose who is made responsible. Though Im hopeful for your timely response and subsequent resolution of my issues, Im fully aware of the 'not-so-positive ' reviews/feedback given to XXXX XXXX and, therefore, will be prepared to submit additional complaints to the XXXX XXXX XXXX , and the Ohio Attorney General.\",\n",

I spoke with  XXXX  and  XXXX  at the  XXXX  number. My husband and I have both explained they are violating the law and can not call me at work and to serve the papers if that is what is needed. They called again on Tuesday and then today called several different people in my company stating they need to know how to go about serving me at work and they need to talk to HR and my supervisor. They called a bout 20 t imes. I asked them again to quit calling and  XXXX  stated they have the right under the FDC to call and when I asked for a supervisor I was hung up on. They would not divulge who the \" outsource \\'\\' person was. At this point I am being harassed and I called The Federal Trade Commission and they stated it sounded like a scam but they can not file a complaint without a company name. This is going to cause problems for me at work. Any help you give would be appreciated.',\n",

Also, my husband was told by one of the representatives at the current mortgage, that our taxes had been raised and that was the reason for the increase.

In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! \\nChase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. \\nThe Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. \\nChase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our \" dedicated relationship manager \\'\\' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.',\n",

I have lost 4 months of work and have even been rescheduling in the Fall and losing my remaining good Saturdays for the year. So I will not be making up that money. I filed for unemployment, but because I am XXXX and work in 2 states ( XXXX XXXX area strattles state line ), I was told I had to call in. The call line sends you to a machine which hangs up on you after directing you back online because they are swamped. So I said I only work in Kansas in order to submit it, but no response or check yet. \\n\\nWe have XXXX  kids and a new home we bought in XXXX of 2019. Our mortgage company is Mr. Cooper. We have missed 2 payments of roughly {$1800.00} each, XXXX and XXXX, so far. I have tried calling, but they also have an automated message directing you back to online and hanging up afterward. But then I discover the only option is a forbearance, admittedly warning I may be disqualified from any stimulus or other aid if I fill it out. On top of that, they say quite sternly XXXX and repeated bluntly by the CEO in a video ) that it is NOT an extension of the life of the loan, but rather a normal extension, requiring a lump sum at the end of the 90 days. As if anyone is saving money right now and able to pay MORE when this nightmare is over! Thats illogical. It is mentioned that payment plans could be made, but this is not what you agree to in the application and it is so arbitrary it is unknown exactly what they could force you to do after agreeing to this form. This seems unwise to enter into. So for these terms, and the threat of not getting aid, I chose not to fill this out. I did however email them explaining this. I have not heard back and they are still not taking calls. \\n\\nWe can not lose our home. And we can not pay a higher monthly payment. We are scared and dont know how to fix this. Meanwhile, the days are passing by and notices are flooding in. We have been able to pay all our other bills, but that will end this month if unemployment or a stimulus doesnt come soon. \\n\\nIf anyone can encourage mortgage companies to extend the life of loans, it would help us immensely. I can only imagine how many people are being hurt by filling out this forbearance, which essentially gives zero aid, and only allows for a little time to then make their account current all at once, without any backpay to do so. It seems dishonest and taking advantage of many people forced to choose this only option. They should be held accountable for making things worse on hurting people everywhere.',\n",

She was listed as on the vehicle account as a driver, and on the auto insurance, which she also disputed 2 payments.

I've since made the repairs using what saved money I have. I'm having troubles catching the vehicle up in order to use it as transportation to an from work.

Recently I made {$800.00} in payments to get the vehicle under 90 days past due. Toyota told me they would give me options after I did that, and vehicle would be taken out of repo status. They denyed my request to move the past due amount to the back of the dept like they agreed. Then sent a repo agent to claim the vehicle. I denyed then the vehicle. And will continue to do so. I've worked hard to buy, keep, maintain, and repair my vehicle. I'm still behind exactly what was disputed. I'm only weeks from fully financially collapsing and losing my home and everything. I've exhausted all my resources to stay afloat. This is my first attempt to ask for help. I need options. Please help.\",\n",

Did n't understand the terms since the only documents they had to give me were in XXXX and i dont read or write XXXX and i told them they said juat sigh here. Then moved and had a hard time paying. When i got a better job the refused to take payments. They use very inappropriate language and talk to me very inappropriately. I have made lots of attempts to make payments. The guy that i talk to actually told me that if i sent in a small payment that was n't at least {$700.00} that he would send it back. Every time i try and call and talk to someone else they tell me there is no one else. I believe that this is an attempt to get more money. Since they have just kept charging me more fees since i have not been able to make any payments. I dont believe i should have to pay {$1400.00} for a {$500.00} loan.\",\n",

Capital One chose to place a stop payment prematurely on the check and in error, they will not admit to this error plainly, will rather state \" Expectations not set correctly \\'\\' as reason for stop payment. A second check was expedited via XXXX second day air and rep ( s ) did not allow enough mail time for prior check before reissuing and thus stopping payment.. The check amount, XXXX, represents the remaining balance in my checking account ending in XXXX. Replacement check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. I left for XXXX XXXX on this day, was not at my address to receive/sign for it or sign check itself. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX picked me up, drove me to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a statement from Mr XXXX stating he picked me up on said date and time. Please see attached document from Mr XXXX, he can be reached at XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. \\n\\nI received information from a XXXX with leadership team at Capital One stating said check was intercepted and signed by a XXXX XXXX whom does not live here, cashed at a XXXX XXXX XXXX which is not my account and do not bank there. A XXXX XXXX with Capital One has replied in re about this, stating the person, XXXX XXXX, lives at my address and the XXXX XXXX Bank account is or was linked to my Capital One account at some point. She also refers to a check deposited to my account from this person sometime ago. My account is now closed and It appears Capital One chose to close it due to account security, they saw the linked account, which I am not aware of, as a possible risk. It appears someone had hacked into my account at some point, added XXXX XXXX account and also used my account to cash a check in the past. Neither of these two incidents are related to loss of funds or constitute receipt of them. \\n\\nIf Capital One will check signatures on check received on XX/XX/XXXX and replacement check delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, they will see signatures are different from another. Also, another check from Capital One covering overdraft and return check fees relating to stop payment shows my true and correct signature, as does the check received on XX/XX/XXXX which was deposited to my XXXX account and is now closed due to overdrawn status. The overdraft is a result of Capital One stopping payment prematurely as stated prior. I\\'ve requested Capital One check signatures, XXXX XXXX did not comply. For argument sake and figuratively speaking even if the person, XXXX XXXX, is related, does not mean funds were not stolen from me as they in fact were..\\n\\nI request someone in office of the President look into this matter which has been ongoing since late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX. To avoid investigating signatures as requested, Capital One chooses to mark complaints as duplicate to avoid doing so. They requested additional time to reply to a prior complaint, which took over a month and then turned around, marked it as duplicate.',\n",

I was in forbearance with Great Lakes and I didnt receive any notice that my forbearance ended. I contacted XXXX XXXX immediately and was told I would be garnished for $ XXXX+/- a month until loans are paid ( {$12000.00} ). I explained that there is no way I can afford this, but I would be willing to pay up to {$300.00} a month. They asked me to fill out documents on my bills, and I did. We went over this in detail during our initial conversation. During this conversation, I was told I could make on time monthly payments for 10 months at $ XXXX/month and that will bring me back on track. I was happy to have this option. I mailed them in as instructed to, and was told they would get back to me with my arrangements. I never heard from them. I called them the first week of XXXX and was told that they never received the documents, and since they didnt, there was nothing they could do. They have moved forward with processing the garnishment and the amount is almost {$800.00} a month. I made this clear that this would put me at risk of losing my home, and assets, and they didnt care. I have no options at this point and I am scared.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs \\'\\', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.\\n\\nAlthough I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.\\n\\n1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.\\n\\n2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.\\n\\n3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.\\n\\n4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.\\n\\n5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.\\n\\n6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..',\n",

They returned results that stated \" all information correct and verified with reporting company \\'\\'. I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE. So apparently crooks don\\'t open accounts on-line???!!! \\nSo I filed WRITTEN disputes to all three Credit Bureaus, sent them all Certified Mail, and just received a response from XXXX stating once again regarding the same account - \" Information verified with reporting agency \\'\\' and nothing more. That\\'s it??? Of course the reporting agency is going to \" confirm \\'\\' that their information is correct, but don\\'t they need to provide some sort of PROOF other than their word?!!!!! What more can I do as a consumer to have this addressed/investigated properly??? \\nThe other account that I am disputing flat out refused to accept the letter that I sent them certified. Now what? I\\'ve filed written dispute as well on this response, but have not gotten a response yet from any of the Credit Bureaus. \\nI need assistance immediately in addressing XXXX  and their investigation processes.

They were saying that I owe about {$18000.00} and respond us back urgent. They called me mulitple times and send me a letter that if i don't respond back they will treat it as confirmed debt and will make me liable. I called them and nobody picked up and i left them 2 to 3 times voicemail that please send everything in writing do not call as I am practicing the Fairness act of Debt collections. \\nAnyway i send them a detailed letter as followed below in text. \\n\\nBilateral Credit Collection XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, RI XXXX XXXX : Account No : XXXX To Whom It May Concern I do not consent to this debt and I totally dispute the validity of the debt in the above-reference account number # XXXX and would like verification from you of the obligation, the amount owed, and proof of a detailed valid assignment of the debt from the original creditor to you. I request everything to be send in written format and no phone calls or text messages. Please send me copies of all documents related to this dispute including along with the following questions answered. \\nQ1 : Who you are you? Who do you represent? provide me a detailed contract copy if you are representing the original Creditor? Provide the facts and proof that you are the original representation?\\n\\nQ2 : What is your direct number and what is the actual company headquarter address?\\n\\nQ3 : What is your professional license information? Also are you registered in Washington state to send the dispute details as per law? As you are based out of state most probably you have to take retain local counsel?\\n\\nQ4 : What was your process of getting the debt from the original creditor? what detailed information you asked or obtained? What was your verification process if it was actually a debt or a dispute? if you did not comply with the law to gather proper evidence of the claim disputes, you are already violating the law time.\\n\\nQ 5 : Before sending the verification of the dispute, did you really investigated on your side what was the core issue why this all happened? \\nQ 4 : Provide all the documents account records, invoices of claims and correspondence on what specific date?\\n\\nQ5 : How you come up with this {$18000.00} amount and what is the breakdown of these charges?\\n\\nQ6 : Based on my knowledge, Debt collectors signed a contract with the original creditor either on a commission basis or buy the debt for pretty cheap amount? By law and fairness Debt Collection Practices Act, you are supposed to provide all that information? How much was the actual amount you bought the debt or dispute for? Is there any documentation/ contract between you and the original creditor. \\nQ7 : How can you seek verification and validation of the debt?\\n\\nI am also exercising my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C 1692, and demand that you cease all communication except with me, my family members and all other third persons. Also you have violated the law of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, by calling multiple times on different dates to pressurize and threaten about the debt when I left a voice message and left a message to one of your agent not to call on my number. Please send me all things in written. \\nYou are here by notifies that if you do not comply with this request, I will immediately file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and to the State Attorney General 's Office. If you are not able to provide the answer to the above questions and proper researched verification of the dispute within 15 to 30 days of time then you are violating the FDCPA detailed Civil and criminal claims will be pursued.\\n\\nI can not pay this debt as I do not consent and I do not validate this debt to be considered as a debt. I am already going through financial hardship, medical issues myself and for my family, and on top of this bilateral Credit collection continues calls and violated the law when even told not to call back that have put more pressure and created more stress environment for myself. \\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX They still called me and last time threaten me to take action against me and report my credit collection right away which they did not. About 2 to 3 weeks passed, then now i have received one more letter from them to call them urgently to resolve as they tried to resolve this case. First of all, I disputed and they failed to provide me with the proof and validity and their connection with the original creditor. They threaten me also voilated by calling me multiple times then it stopped but last time they called when i clearly mentioned al communication in written as my right. Then they started bashing out and said you are this and threaten to take action. funny thing is that there employees can not take control of this small small tasks, how come a company owner saying i am the owner and i do all the work lol it is funny to me, that means the workers are stupid and not capable of handling an danswering and resolving and seeing the case. Why the owner of the company will do basic paper work job and call like a customer service that is strange to me. They also have mishandling and putting false claims on other people and there are reports on betterbusiness burea. Anyway i have my proof of recording of leaving them message to just send everything in written and they still voilated it. Also I have the recording of the person who said I am the owner and i will report it right away and shut the phone and was not even listening.They need to know they have to pay for the compensation and my waste of time if they plan to drag it further. Also they need to stop this immediately otherwise I will report them.\",\n",

Based on a program offering 12 months of no interest, we purchased two fairly expensive watches from XXXX XXXX, a company based in New York. We were informed that as long as we made 12 equal payments on time no interest would be charged. I made every single payment on time as agreed. My last payment was made in XXXX and was only {$26.00} because we had paid so much down already. I was shocked to receive a bill in the mail for all interest that would've been due had I not made any payments. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, the day I receive the bill to figure out why I am being charged. They basically explained that even though the last payment of {$26.00} was not due until several days after it was received ( I paid it before the due date ), the 12 months no interest program expired a few days before the payment was actually due. So basically I got charged over {$570.00} for a {$26.00} final payment that was paid early. I have excellent credit and strive to always pay my bills on time. I have never filed a complaint or had an issue with a 12 month no interest arrangement. This was extremely deceptive. Even the representative I spoke to thought it was unfair, but there was nothing he could do. \\n\\nPlease help!!!\",\n",

I had problems setting it up online. So I tried over the phone. I was told I had everything set up online and all accounts, charges, settings were set. \\nWell, after the first month, I started getting late notices on payments in XXXX 2018. I called and doubled checked my online account. Everything looked normal and already set up. On the phone, the representative would go over my account and said all was fine, it must be a glitch. And submit a work ticket. I never heard anything back.\\n\\nThen 2-3 weeks later, I would get more mail stating I was failing to make regular monthly payments on my loan to BBVA. \\nI once again, called and talked to a representative over the phone. Same thing. They said it was taken care of. \\nIn XX/XX/2018, I finally went into a local BBVA bank and said I wanted to speak to someone in charge and find out why my payments were not being submitted and why the auto withdrawal was not going thru. After 5 days, it was finally straightened out. BBVA apparently had the wrong account number from my bank. I had submitted it correctly, but they kept entering one too many digits. \\nHowever, it is because of 2-3 months of NONE payments, I believe my credit history has suffered. I have a score of XXXX, as of XXXX-18. I believe this to be unfair since it was not my error back in XX/XX/2018, when BBVA made the mistake on my loan account. I wish for this to be corrected, reviewed and addressed. Since the correction, I have been late on NO accounts and fully pay all loans and bills on time with no past due or collection agencies.',\n",

The response that I received back from this company was very disheartening and I feel like I am being taken advantage of by this company and the credit bureau 's. I am going on about 12 months of trying to fix this issue, and everyone is simply ignoring me and disregarding my request. The letter that I sent to XXXX/XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX clearly stated exactly what I needed to prove to them that the information may be reported in error. However, they simply replied back stating that I didn't request anything in specific. To prove my claims, I've attached the letter I sent, with my request inside of that letter, and also their response from my letter, which came over a month and a half later. This company has a reputation of illegal loan shark transactions and the accounts they set up are with ridiculous late fees, and the billing cycles are set up to increase the likelihood of missing a payment. I am at my wits end with this situation and I need this resolved immediately!\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"In XX/XX/2018 for about 10 months I made my daughter an authorized user of my account. Before doing so Barclay Card assured me that she could be a user and that it would have no impact on her credit. Only I was responsible for all charges on the account. She never signed anything. I asked for her to be added as an authorized signer to my account. BarclayCard sent her a card of her own to use. About XX/XX/XXXX she was finished with her need to use my credit card and I removed her as a user. \\n\\nShe went to check her credit bureau the other day and found Barclay Card to be reporting MY full balance to her credit report. She called Barclay Card and they said they could not talk with her about it since she is not a signer on the account. I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. \\n\\nTheir fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed. \\n\\nThis is the exact kind of bullying behavior a big bank is supposed to have stopped a long time ago. So they have made an error and now it is MY problem to fix it. Unacceptable. And Illegal. \\n\\nBarclay Card has my complaint and my daughter 's complaint by phone and now through this correspondence. If they do not correct the erroneous reporting in a reasonable amount of time I will be forced to take more serious actions regarding the fraud they have committed against my daughter. Not to mention the illegal release of information about my account to her ( she should have never known the balance of my card at anytime, ever ). \\n\\nIn my conversation with two Barclay representatives on the phone this evening both confirmed that the reporting should not have occurred as she was merely an authorized user with no responsibility for the credit and that the only way I can correct a credit reporting error, even if it is completely their fault, is in writing to a mailing address with supporting documentation which includes my daughter sending them, by mail, a full copy of the erroneous credit reporting. That exposes my family to unnecessary risk. The credit report they want me to send through the mail has all types of personally identifiable information contained within it.\",\n",

The letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX in regards to a debt owed to XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$730.00} ; however, I did not incur any debt when I moved from this apartment complex back in XX/XX/XXXX. I was never notified, by XXXX XXXX. ; of any questions following my leaving their site neither, and they had all my contact information. I responded with a letter of explanation to NCS on XX/XX/XXXX requesting information. I received only a copy of my lease and a screenshot print out of an incorrect move out date. This printout did not match the ledger details or any other paperwork from XXXX XXXX that I had received in the past. This appeared to be a scam. I received another letter XX/XX/XXXX from a XXXX XXXX of   XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) and spoke with a XXXX XXXX and XXXX - they both said that they are collecting a debt for XXXX XXXX, but when I called them on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to the reps who said that they were representing XXXX, then they said XXXX XXXX, and they yelled that I need to get a lawyer when I tried to explain that I did not owe any money, and I could provide proof. I called National Credit Systems, ( XXXX ) on the the same day, and they mentioned this law office on their phone system. Then, I spoke with a rep who says that the XXXX XXXX of  XXXX XXXX XXXX represents National Credit Systems. It appears that the debt collector, National Credit Systems , Inc. is representing themselves as the XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. in XXXX, GA. I have reached out XXXX XXXX several times, and finally was able to speak with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ; who informed me that they are no longer tied to the company XXXX, and she was not aware of any debt collection proceedings through them. She advised me to contact XXXX at ( XXXX ) XXXX but no one answers their phone. A collection from National Credit Systems remains on my Credit report with all 3 agencies since XX/XX/XXXX, and has prevented me from rental applications, and has reduced my credit score to prevent me from other purchase and application activities.

In addition to these issues several of these same accounts have exceed their legal reporting periods of seven years, with multiple that are over 10 years. In previous communications via letter I was told that such reports could not be removed due to regulations promulgated by the DOE and the FCRA.

I opened an account online on XX/XX/19 and transferred {$50000.00} from my external bank to Capital 1 bank on XX/XX/19. I kept my daily balance above {$50000.00} until XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/19, I transferred some money out. I thought I already passed 90 day requirement. In XX/XX/XXXX., I contacted Capital 1 to check the bonus status. Surprisingly I was told that I was 1 day short of requirement. Based on their explanation, I have to deposit within 10 days of account opening. Then I have to maintain a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for 90 days following the initial funding period, which is 10 days. So even I have kept my daily balance above {$50000.00} longer than 90 days, I am not qualified for {$500.00} bonus. I went back to read the fine print carefully for this promotion. It states that \" Deposit {$50000.00} or more of new money from an external bank within the first 10 days of account opening. You will earn the {$500.00} bonus once youve maintained a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for the first 90 days following the Initial Funding Period \\'\\'. It did not clearly and specifically pointed out that the initial funding period is TEN days, regardless when you funded account after opening it. I thought funding period referred to the time between opening account and funding account, as long as it is no more than 10 days. If I funded my new account on the 10th day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 90 days, I would have qualified for the bonus. In my case, I funded my new account on the 3rd day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 97 days, I am not qualified for bonus. The fine print words are very ambiguous and confusing. If it made it clear at the first place, I would have kept {$50000.00} for longer time. I hope Capital 1 Bank can reconsider my case and issue the bonus that I deserve. Thank you very much for your help!',\n",

I questioned him on the fact that the math on the PDF that was sent did not add up and that the principal balance was exactly the same as what I see online without the reapplied payment. If in fact they did reapply that payment then there would be a significant difference in the principal balance. I was then told that it was a programming issue and that the computer system shows different information online as to what they have in the system, I informed him that I am a computer engineer and what he is saying sounds very suspicious. I asked to speak with a supervisor who also argued with me about this imaginary reapplied payment. The PDF that was sent to me was only available to view for 45 mins then it was removed from the system. I have since sold my house and probably can't recover the money that they have shorted me, however I am extremely concerned that they are possibly doing the same to other consumers\",\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'In XXXX I had a mortgage with Cardinal Financial Company. My mortgage at this time was escrowed for both taxes and insurance. In XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my existing mortgage through Cardinal Financial Company for a loan that did not have escrow. During my loan process the month prior my payoff was ordered. In that same month my Insurance was due to be disbursed from my escrow account. My Insurance was not paid out as it should have been as the policy renewal date was XX/XX/XXXX. I was not made aware at the time of closing or even prior that my insurance was not paid out of my escrow in XXXX and that my renewal for XX/XX/XXXX needed to be paid by me for the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX policy. This in turn caused by policy to lapse for 12mo causing me to have to purchase a worse case policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) vs. the premium policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) that I had. \\nI reached out to Cardinal Financial Company in mid-XX/XX/XXXX once I found out my policy cancelled due to non-payment despite my account being escrowed. Initially I was told by the Insurance Department of Cardinal Financial that they did not get an invoice ( my further research found that was false as the insurance premium amount had been updated in their system to show the invoice amount for the renewal policy ). I was told that since I refinanced I should have paid it when my escrow was returned to me ( Issue with this : My insurance was due XX/XX/XXXX and I did not close on my refinance until XX/XX/XXXX - the insurance should have already been disbursed and paid by escrow ) ; I was also told when my payoff was ordered they netted my escrow from the payoff amount so all escrow payouts were froze ( I did not request this ) ; I received a letter in the mail this past week referencing my new loan and was told that their records show my insurance was good through XX/XX/XXXX and I needed to reach out to my new servicer ( False : They admitted in a conversation I had with them that they received a Notice to Cancel the day before I closed on my refinance ( XX/XX/XXXX ) - They still never said anything ) ; The last conversation I had with them they said that once a payoff is ordered they stop all escrow disbursements for 45/days and I was notified of this however could not tell me when or how I was notified ( I reviewed all of my closing docs that I signed and never signed anything about this. The only notice that was provided at close was my settlement statement that indicated I needed to cover my property expense going forward which I was aware of as I no longer escrowed ).',\n",

I have no business dealings with this company and have never spoke with anyone, form this company. As for the original creditor ( XXXX XXXX ) I am not a member of their gym, I have never joined, the gym and there is no documentation or signed agreement, between my self and the company. This is not my account and it is showing on my credit account, wrongfully and illegally. XXXX ( Collection agency ) Has never contacted me regarding, this account and I have never done any business with this company. The original creditor is XXXX XXXX XXXX and I did visit the office. But, I did have insurance coverage. If there was a co pay due or any additional monies due, that wasn't covered by my insurance, I should have been given a bill, at the time of visit or at the very least, mailed out to me. I have never received any contact or bills forward to me. Therefore I had no knowledge of any outstanding monies. In addition, my insurance company, didn't notify me of me having a co pay of a portion of the bill that had to be covered my me. Therefore this debt is a error and if the debt is my portion of the bill, why wasn't I billed, so that the matter could be taken care of, in a timely fashion. There are guidelines in place, that require a notification period, before the medical debt can be place on the credit report. This was completely overlooked and not followed, as I have never received any notification, via phone, text, email or U.S. Postal service. XXXX XXXX ( collection agency ) the original creditor is ( XXXX XXXX ) I have never had any contact or transacted any business with XXXX XXXX  and the debt with XXXX XXXX, is not my account. I have lived at the same address for years and this cable bill does not belong to me. If some one has taken my personal information and opened a cable account, without my knowledge, I am not accountable for that account. XXXX XXXX doesn't have any documentation, where I have agreed to service or signed for service.\",\n",

I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. \\nFirst I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. \\nAnd secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... .. \\nEthos said they would explore this but just said well tough..\",\n",

Prior to this i looked at inventory online and saw what I wanted and didn't want anything else but this XXXX XXXX XXXX sports bike. I sat with one of the sales guys and he told me I was approved and that my loan would be for 2 years. I was so excited about this I was not even thinking, i was signing away paperwork. The bike in the dealer was in the amount of {$5900.00} with dealer fee and tag title, came out to XXXX. I gave a down payment of XXXX. I have had my bike for 2 years and I am still making payments on this bike. I asked the place Cycleone Financial,  where i send my payments when i look at my documents they had me sign a Lease document on a used bike that had 32,000 miles on it, on the paperwork it states it had 18,500 and that is wrong. When i am finish paying this bike it would total {$14000.00}. If i would have known this i would have not bothered to take the bike. This bike since i took it out the dealers lot has given me problems, non stop. I asked and i was not able to even trade my bike in for another bike, i wanted to because the bike was giving me to much problems, i was denied that opportunity for a trade in. I was blind sided due to my excitement, this bike is not worth XXXX, not even with interest rate would this had come out to that much. My bike has been to a shop over 6 times in 2 and half years. I take very good care of it, its a passion I have but all these issue is uncalled for. When i first took it out all the lights were coming off, I had to use my warranty for a starter the 1st year. Thinking it was leased when I found out you would think they would let you get into something else especially when they automatically put you on a lease without you knowing. the paperwork from the dealer itself has my sisters social. Not on the one being attached. Motor has been replaced as well, like come on! I am really really upset.\",\n",

I called to check the status and the late payment was still reporting. I asked to speak with a supervisor. She put me on hold and then disconnected the call.

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'Good Morning, Im submitting this complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, because they reported 30 day late payments to the three credit bureaus on my vehicle loan. \\nThe vehicle loan account is in me and my husbands name ; On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband went to apply for an apartment and was denied due to all the late payments that where on his credit report. According to the apartment complex, the late payments showed up on Transuion, XXXX, and  XXXX. These are the late payments that are currently on our credit report ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX to get clarification on these late payments, because according to my documents I was never 30 days late. The first person I spoke with a XXXX   over the phone was XXXX and I inquired about all the late payments that were reported to the three credit bureaus. XXXX stated, I only see that XX/XX/XXXX, has been reported to the credit bureaus. Thats when I chimed in and said, According to the credit report that the apartment complex pulled on my husband, XXXX reported these months as being 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ). \\nXXXX stated that she has limited ability to see whats on my vehicle loan account far as payments are concerned. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor, and she stated should would be it will be a while before the supervisor would be on the call. I waited 30 mins before XXXX the collections supervisor go on the line. He introduced himself as XXXX the collections supervisor. I asked XXXX, could he tell me what late payments did XXXX report to the 3 credit bureaus because my husband had his credit report pulled by the apartment complex and was denied the apartment because of several late payments on his credit report, I explained to him me and my husband are both on the car loan. XXXX stated, I have limited visablity to you car loan account. I said, You are a supervisor and you cant tell me what 30 day late payments XXXX submitted to the credit bureaus. XXXX said, We report differently to the credit bureaus, for instance if it the XXXX and we havent received a payment by then we report you to the credit bureaus. I informed him that was illegal because by law you must be 30 days late on payments before you can submit it to the 3 credit bureaus. XXXX is giving me this illegal information on a recorded XXXX line. He instructed me to send a letter to the XXXX direct dispute department. After he gave me that information, I informed him that I would be submitting a complaint with the CFPB about these late payments and this wasnt the first time that XXXX  sent incorrect info to the credit bureaus on this car loan. \\nPlease remove inaccurate late payments for these months from the 3 credit bureaus ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Also is there a way from preventing the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from being submitted to these three credit bureaus Transuion, XXXX and XXXX. \\nIve attached a copy of screenshot from my car payments when I submitted them when I pay them via online. I dont have the screenshot of XXXX because it was in my old phone and it just blacked out on me and for some reason it wasnt saved in the cloud.',\n",

A company conned me into allowing them to remove {$29.00} on the XXXX of each month, a recurring transaction stating that the money would be paid toward my student loans. The money has been taken out of my Wells Fargo Checking Account religiously for years. In XX/XX/2018 I entered a branch of Wells Fargo, after learning that the school loan consolidation company was a scam, and filed a fraudulent claim. Going back the life of the authorization and was told that the Fraud Department would be in contact but I was assured that the withdrawal of funds would stop, per my revoking the authorization. I was contacted in XX/XX/XXXX by the Wells Fargo Fraud Department and was told that they found my authorization for recurring withdrawals to be sufficient and denied my fraudulent claim. Even with me supplying proof that the company listed as taking the funds out was reported by the XXXX  as being out of business and was a fraudulent company. At which point I notified the representative from the Wells Fargo Fraud Department and the branch I originally went into of my rights to 'revoke ' any previously authorized recurring withdrawals, stating I wanted an immediate seizure of any future withdrawals and requested that the withdrawn funds for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX be refunded. Please be advised that this all took place before the XX/XX/XXXX withdrawal was to take place as well as the withdrawal for XX/XX/XXXX which was also removed.. However, the withdrawal for XX/XX/XXXX did take place and nothing has been refunded. In fact, Wells Fargo has informed me that I am not permitted to stop this withdrawal from recurring even with the revocation of my original approval. Attached please find the letter I sent to the Fraud Department and the Branch itself.\",\n",

She thought she should have received yesterday, we received this morning at about XXXX. XXXX asked the check be deposited in her Wells Fargo account, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CO. The check was made out to my husband XXXX, he signed it, made out a deposit slip with XXXX ' account number and presented it to the bank. He was told the bank could not accept third party checks. XXXX went to our XXXX XXXX and cashed the check. With cash, {$3900.00}, in hand he went back to Wells Fargo and was told they could not accept the cash without XXXX present because there was no history of the cash and there was no way to trace. Without argument he went to the college, met XXXX and paid the tuition. Not being happy, called Wells Fargo Customer Service, spoke with XXXX, ( XXXX XXXX ) I asked to speak with a manager, he said he would if I explained my concern. I told him and he said my husband was given the correct information. I are repeated my initial request. I was transferred to XXXX. XXXX explained it was a Federal reg which all banks have to follow. I asked for the req number so I could contact my Congressman. He put me on hold and told me he was incorrect it wasn't Federal by banking policy. I asked if he knew the reason as he had explained he was in the executive section of Wells Fargo. He didn't know. He did say the reason was probably due to fraud or counterfeit. I asked he transfer me to someone in a higher position. He said there was no one higher ( I believe he said this ). I stated there is always someone higher and he transferred me to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) I explained, she gave me generally the same answers. I asked if they suspected my husband of fraud or counterfeiting why weren't the police called. He had in had American money, not foreign from our bank. He was making a deposit into the bank, not taking any money out. He would have left any info. He was not a member of any carter or mafia. I find this utterly ridiculous. I asked for the person ( people ) who had made this policy. XXXX explained because of the banking mess ( my word, not hers ) several years ago banks made this decision. I still don't understand. She told me there isn't anyone I could speak with. So I asked for a banking commission or something. She told me of CFPB. Is there an answer why Wells Fargo or as I was told any bank not accepting cash for a deposit?\",\n",

It was the loan payoff check that I was forced to resubmit because their personnel could not read and match the loan number on the original check with their own loan statement payment coupon which was mailed with the original loan payment. A payment they clearly received in time to make an earlier payoff, since they returned that original check to me. Their own rejection form ( all of which has been included with my previous complaints [ # XXXX and # XXXX ] ) falsely claims the payment was rejected for missing/improper loan identification number. Their inability to admit to their own negligence with such messages is becoming a harassment. What is it going to take to straighten these people out?',\n",

When talking with NewRez, LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgaging Services, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX. SC XXXX, Phone # XXXX, They are insisting that the property taxes have been paid to the XXXX County Appraisal District on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\n\\nThe first call to NewRez was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a copy of the cashed checks they informed they sent to The XXXX County Appraisal District. I was informed I would receive copies in 2 weeks via email & XXXX. When I did not receive either a call back, email or anything in the mail, I contacted NewRez a 2nd time on approximately XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed my request was submitted and I would be receiving copies of the cashed checks by the XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI called back on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke with XXXX, to follow-up on the status on copies of the cashed checks. At this time is was informed that the money I pay for my escrow account was sent to the XXXX County Central Appraisal District and paid someone else 's property taxes. I was also informed that it appears as though I am not the legal owner of my own property. I was informed that XXXX XXXX, a Tax Specialist for NewRez was reviewing the complaint and would be contacting me. \\n\\nI called on the XX/XX/XXXX afternoon as I still had not received a call back from NewRez nor XXXX XXXX. I was informed that the complaint is still under investigation and that XXXX XXXX would be calling me back with an explanation and resolution. I requested to speak with Mr. XXXX, and I was denied the opportunity. \\n\\nI called back on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, the person I spoke with, XXXX XXXX XXXX, informed that her note show that the property taxes were paid. She refused to allow me to speak with her manager and to let me speak with either XXXX XXXX or someone else in that department. She eventually transferred my call to someone else and the call went to voice message. I left a message. \\n\\nTo this date I have not received a copy of the cashed checks or any other concrete evidence that show my property taxes have been paid as I was instructed would happen. I have not received one email or one call with any explanation as to what is going on with my money and how they are handling the issue to in paying my taxes as XXXX County Appraisal District has not yet received any payment. No one will tell me what is going on. I am trying to refinance and penalties for late payment on my property taxes are accruing. \\n\\nI am in the process of refinancing my mortgage and this holdup is affecting my contract with the new lender and time lost will affect my loan rates.\",\n",

Our commercial loan officer was XXXX XXXX XXXX we meet with him at the bank about the loan in XXXX CT. We closed on the construction loan in XX/XX/XXXX for a 1 year construction loan with 2 6 month extension if needed. We started construction and everything was going fine. We had know problem making the loan payment because they came out of the checking with XXXX XXXX XXXX automatic. Due to changes in construction and weather we had come to the anniversary date on the construction loan and need the extension for 6 months. We reach out to XXXX XXXX early in the process to get it done so there was know problem with the loan. We than go the paperwork in the mail showing amount due on XXXX XXXX XXXX we were not done with the house. We reached out to XXXX XXXX about it and he said they were working on it. He would get back to us with something by the end of the week. We reach out again he said that they would have it done by early next week not to worry about it. We got the paperwork work late from them and than they put a late payment on my credit. We called XXXX XXXX about it and he said that should have not happen and he would take care of it for us. We tried and tried to get this fixed with him and XXXX XXXX also from XXXX XXXX XXXX she was our mortgage officer for the end of the loan when it was to go to a first mortgage on the property. We reach out to XXXX XXXX again after we closed on the mortgage to get this fixed he than at that time said to us that they can not fix it because they have an A rating an it would not look good for them. I said over and over to him you said not to worry about it you would fix it. He reply sorry he can not fixed it. I can not believe that after all this that was his comment to us. Not good business practice. Thank you XXXX XXXX',\n",

I have been informed the bill was sent onXX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX not available for view, electronically through the GMfinancial website and my online account, and I have requested on multiple occasions to have my bill sent to me. GM has provided no resolution to me not receiving my bill in the mail and refused to send it to me electronically to ensure receipt. It is nearing the time that payment would be due to avoid any negative credit reporting to the credit bureaus. I have also explained to them that I will be moving which will further delay me receiving a mailed bill because it has taken them over a month to issue the statement.',\n",

I don't know who XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is, and no validation of this debt has been given to me. No original creditor was listed. I was not given a right to dispute letter, nor anything else regarding this debt at all. On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX I contact them and asked how they got my information and disputed the validity of the debt and asked them to remove this from my credit report. They are refusing. I should have 30 days to dispute this debt and I was not given any notice to activate my rights. Instead it was placed on my credit report. I've contacted the number listed on the report XXXX. They where unable to validate this account belong to me. I requested proof in writing.. I have also contacted Trans Union, XXXX, and XXXX and disputed it. When I contacted Trans Union at XXXX, I spoke to a Fraud Specialist, XXXX XXXX she informed me that a similar item showed up on my credit report in XX/XX/2015 and was disputed and removed. This is around the time I found out my SS # was used by someone other than me. I asked to speak to a Supervisor with Trans Union. I spoked to Mrs. XXXX, and asked how can an item that was disputed and removed in XX/XX/2015 be placed back on my credit report. Once it is removed, it should be removed. I stated that I disputed it then because it was not mine, and it was removed but you placed it on there again. The Supervisor at Trans Union did not remove the item. My credit score has dropped 75 points due to this and I have no control over it. I am in the process of buying my house and this is affecting me drastically and putting my dream of owning a home in jeopardy.\",\n",

I applied for a loan and I was denied, one of the reasons for denial was unacceptable banking behavior. XXXX has repeatedly told me to call back in ten days and the report will generate with answers and every time I call back during said timeframe its either not generated or closed out. In the near future, Im applying for a mortgage and this marking on my credit file is hindering. Its been way over seven years and I never was contacted about fraud activity nor participated in any fraudulent activity.',\n",

I submitted disputes. I submitted a police report and my DL as well. I received an email from them stating that they needed another police report or all pages. I have submitted all pages of the police report. There are no additional pages. I have submitted everything that they have requested. The accounts that are not mine are as follows : XXXX/XXXX  XXXX XXXX Now XXXX XXXXt XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I am not pleased with what is going on and what they are not doing and how this information has not been removed and/or blocked from my report. I need this removed and rectified asap before they find themselves in the middle of a lawsuit for having information on my report that doesn't belong to me, that isn't in my name, and that isn't associated with me at all.\",\n",

I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and told them I did NOT apply for credit ( they denied a credit card to the person who fraudulently requested it using my info ). I also called the XXXX reporting agencies and explained everything to them and told them to please remove these inquiries from my files as I did NOT request credit from any place. They said they would take care of it but it is still listed. A hard inquiry is taking my credit score down a few points. I also told the agencies that I will not be getting any new credit cards and to put a freeze on my accounts so that no one else can request credit.

I called Chase to request that my card type be changed to one without an annual fee and that the annual fee be refunded. \\n\\nDespite making this request 4-5 times, the request was not processed. I finally escalated my request to a supervisor and it was processed however the annual fee refunded was pro-rated as of the date the change as made where as, under the terms of the agreement, I was entitled to a full refund of the annual fee.\",\n",

If the balance is {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX it should state XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX.\\n\\nThe next problem is the XXXX they furnished in the letter and sent to the irs shows an identifiable event code of ( F ) By Agreement. This would have to mean that I made an agreement with them to cancel the debt owed for less than the full balance. This would be false.\\n\\nThe date of the Identifiable event is XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the Irs regulations prior to XX/XX/XXXX. If a debt has not been paid for 36 months and active collection is not pursued then a XXXX is to be issued even if the debt is not discharged. The account was delinquent prior to XX/XX/XXXX and closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. A XXXX should have been issued prior to XX/XX/XXXX. So in this case the XXXX was issued in the wrong year with incorrect event coding Finally according to XXXX  county land records there was a mortgage assignment filed for this account. The Assignment of mortgage was not to Chase Home Finance nor Chase Home Lending. Which gives reason to believe the incorrect creditor is reporting the debt and that they do not have a valid claim. Whether the Assignment of mortgage is valid is speculative considering the notary had been suspended and the agent on behalf of Chase may or may not have worked for Chase.\\n\\nMy actions have been contacting Chase about the misrepresentations and they have stated the account has been charged off since XX/XX/XXXXbut it is still open and they are reporting correctly.\\n\\nI disputed with Credit Reporting Agencies to validate the information which is clearly incorrect. The came back that they only report what they are told to and that it was validated.\\n\\nI have submitted a prior complaint to CFPB which contacted Chase which responded with the letter that I have explained.\\n\\nI have continually ran into problems getting credit due to this account reporting the charge off as XX/XX/XXXX since Derogatory Credit waiting periods require 4 years though the Charge Off had occurred XX/XX/XXXX. The cancellation of debt was XX/XX/XXXX which is not a charge off especially if the account was already charged off.',\n",

On my report, it lists the liabilities and assets being {$0.00}. This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached. On several dates, I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information. I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk 's office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus. They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus. The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit. XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification.\\n\\nMy complaint is this, I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the {$0.00} assets and {$0.00} Liabilities on my report for the BK. Pertaining to the XXXX account, they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting. The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached. I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules. The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification. The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information, when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK, 1 ) it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and have {$0.00} liabilities and {$0.00} assets reported 2 ) the bureaus claimed they verified the information, yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts. Also, I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency ( NO third party can verify per FCRA ) as a third party.\\n\\nThis leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK. For the XXXX account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days.\\n\\nIn my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account. The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can't provide any proof. If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests.\\n\\nI would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report.\",\n",

I wasnt able to pay The whole amount back so they tried to ACH my account. It rejected and I set up to start making payments on the balance of {$580.00}. I paid {$280.00} towards the balance. On XX/XX/2019 I talked to XXXX. I told her I had {$80.00} I could bring her when I got off work. She started telling my my minimum payment was {$91.00}. I didnt have the extra {$11.00}, but I told her I would try to come up with it. I couldnt come up with it, so I wasnt able to make the payment. On XX/XX/2019 they sent in the ACH for {$580.00} to my bank account. My bank paid it in full on XX/XX/2019. They never took into account the {$280.00} I had already paid towards the balance owed. I called asking why they didnt consider the money I had already paid and XXXX told me I could just bring something showing it was paid by my bank and get a refund. Well on XX/XX/2019 I went up there for my refund. They refused to give it to me. They said they had to wait for their supervisor to approve it, or the system to let me have it. I called everyday trying to get my money back. On XX/XX/2019 my husband finally called their call center to make a complaint. The lady looked in the system she said your account has been paid and closed. She said just call up there and ask for your refund they have to give it to you. I told her I already did that and they refused giving it to me. She said they have no reason to hold onto your money. I will call the supervisor over that branch and have her over ride this. She said I will also have her call you directly when she gets out of her meeting. XXXX called me at XXXX cst she also refused to give me my money until XX/XX/2019 and told me how it was my fault they sent the check in basically. She even told me that the center lady didnt tell me they had no reason to hold my money. XXXX did not know my husband was on 3 way listening to the call center lady tell me this. XXXX also told me on XX/XX/2019 that Dotty didnt refuse my payment that I could of paid {$20.00} if that was all I had. I told her that was not explained to me by XXXX. On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX I went to my bank. I talked to them about possible rejecting the ACH. They told me it is to late they had already paid Advance America off on XX/XX/2019. They gave me a print out of my account showing nothing was pending and said take that and try again to get my money refunded to me. I did and XXXX finally refunded only {$250.00} of the {$280.00} I paid them. I dont think pay day loans should be able to send a ACH for The whole amount when someone has paid on something. This is theft! This is ridiculous I had to chase my own money around like this!',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"I closed on my home in XXXX with Homebridge Financial Services. Everything was going fine payment wise until my family and I were affected by hurricane Matthew XXXX. I had damage to my home and my children and I had to evacuate. I had damages to my home, I lost power and my food. As a new homeowner, I was dropped from my homeowner 's insurance company, because I had filed a claim. Homebridge allowed me to make arrangements to pay my mortgage. Then in XXXX I had a loss of income and was not able to pay my mortgage. Also in XXXX, we had another hurricane and had to evacuate again and XXXX loss wages. Homebridge had me complete some paperwork to begin trying to make a way to save me from going into foreclosure. I filled out the loan modification papers and I believe everything was put on hold while I was going through the modification process. All the while going through this process, someone kept coming to my home creeping my family and I out, by putting a tag on my door with a handwritten note indicating for me to call Homebridge. I kept asking why is this happening when they know I am complying with what I am being told. Homebridge stated that they are aware that someone is coming out, but its protocol to see if someone is still living in the property, but they do not know the name of the company that is coming to my home. In XXXX, I was approved for trial modification to pay {$850.00} for three months. After the three months, I was told that my modification will be reviewed to determine if I would be approved. Every time I would call into Homebridge ( after my three months ), they would tell me that Im still in the trial modification and that even though its after the 90 days they are still working to get my modification approved. This extended all the way until XX/XX/XXXX. I was given a letter stating that my loan modification was approved to continue to pay {$850.00} and my new terms and agreement would be sent out to me and that someone would come out to my home to certify my documents. I received the documents via post-mail. The VERY next day these same documents were taped to my door ( creeping me out again ). I called Homebridge about it and really did not know why this would happen or who did it. Nevertheless, I contact XXXX they come out to my home in XX/XX/XXXX to notarize my paperwork and to send it back off to Homebridge for finalization. I called Homebridge after XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX to find out if they received my signed documents. They said that they did not. I called for about 2 weeks and finally they were located. Even with them now finding my document, I was still considered in a trial. Every time I called Homebridge about getting things finalized, Ive heard different stories about my loan being transferred to another company, then I was told that it was not being transferred. When I inquired about my modification approval been signed by Homebridge, they stated that they sent it out somewhere for recording and are waiting to get it back. Later I learned that the recording was here in my own county. I called down to the clerks office to inquire about the recording and I was told the only recording they had was when I first purchased the home in XXXX. I called back to Homebridge to inform them of this information and that I wanted to have my sign contract. I kept getting the runaround about the contract, so I later filed a grievance on the corporate level because I had learned once again that in fact my loan was being sold ; and that I was being transferred effective XX/XX/XXXX. I questioned Homebridge and ask them how could they transfer my loan and my business is not finalized yet and I still dont have my contract? After filing my grievance, I received via email my execute loan modification. I inquired about my payments, stating that I had been paying since XX/XX/XXXX was not being recorded with the credit bureaus. Homebridge informed me that all of these things would be taking care of prior to me transferring over to the new loan company, but that was not the truth. My loan transferred over to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX to inquire about my loan and they stated that they were not able to discuss with me fully until the loan was fully transferred over and to them give it about a week or two. So I gave it a couple weeks to inquire and I was told by the Representative that it takes about 60 days for my loan to be fully transferred over, but that I would not experience the issues that I had with Homebridge. They stated that it should be a smooth transition. This information was not the truth either. No sooner than after my loan transferred over to XXXX XXXX, I started receiving foreclosure letters and threatening letters from a company called XXXX. I never heard of them before, so I contacted them online to see who they were and I reluctantly created an account because I thought someone was using my name fraudulently. I scrolled down to the bottom of their website that I saw that they were Doing Business As XXXX XXXX. I realized that this was the same company. I contacted the company and shared with them my concerns and everything that I experienced with Homebridge. I asked if they are aware that my loan is being transferred over, why am I receiving foreclosed letters, threatening letters, and stating that I owe all of this money? I was told by my single point of contact at XXXX that this is typically their process. I was told that I would not able to pay my mortgage until my loan was fully transferred over to them. They gave me an email address to their Escalations department to send them something in writing because I wanted to request a letter stating that while going through this process, I am not allowed to pay my loan. The Escalations department sent me everything but I what I requested. As time went on I still was receiving letters stating that I owe all this money. I kept calling back because I was fearful of losing my home because everything was not fully transferring over from Homebridge. When I talk to a XXXX Rep, they stated that my loan had transferred over enough so that I can make a payment. I made a lump sum of {$1700.00} for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( combined ). I told him that I really wanted to get this issue resolved and get on with my life. They told me that they can not do anything until they received contract signed by me and Homebridge. They said Homebridge only sent them an unsigned copy. I told them that I have a signed copy of the executed contract. I sent it to my single point of contact, she never acknowledge that she received my modification. I left her voicemails, stating if she did not get me, she could leave a detail message informing that she got it. She never verified via phone or email that she received it. I later spoke to another Rep that told me that I am not allowed to email my contract to a contact and that I needed to send it to Loss Mitigation. I learned that the single point of contact will was no longer my contact and I had been transferred to someone else at XXXX. I requested to speak to a manager at that point because again here it is again my business is not finalized and yet Im being transferred over again. I spoke with a supervisor who stated to me that it looks like the modification that I have would most likely have to be done all over again and that they would work get me a better modification amount then what I currently have. The supervisor also told me that if I was to submit the contract for them to honor the modification, that it could put me further in debt because only a portion of the money was given to them. She asked that I give her time to work on it. Meanwhile I continue to receive letters, but this time the payment amount came down. I received invoice letters for {$980.00}. I received invoice letters for {$1200.00}. I called to inquire about that and none of the people that I spoke to at XXXX  could explain to me why am I receiving figures other than approved modification amount of {$850.00}. They said that if I only pay the {$850.00}, there will be a balance and late fee. They see on their system that my escrow amount has not changed, they see my property tax hasnt changed. Quite frankly the property taxes and escrow arrears all were considered and calculated when I was approved for the modification at Homebridge making it {$850.00}. I was even told by XXXX they see an amount of {$850.00} as my payment. Where are these figures coming from? No one seems to know. Due to all that I have experienced, I am writing/filing this complaint because I am fearful of losing my home. My anxiety level is to the roof. I am having trouble sleeping because of this is constantly on my mind. Im unable to function properly at work and basic daily routine because I dont know if one day when I come home, will there be a home to go to. The point of this complaint is to have my contract honored. I am okay to keep my {$850.00} executed contract without penalty and be free from any other additional debt and/or bankruptcy. This complaint is to have XXXX honor my terms and conditions of this contract and to send me over to XXXX XXXX and remove me from XXXX Debt Collection/Loss Mitigation Department. I did everything that Homebridge requested of me for the past year and a half to get this modification approved. I should not be penalized in this manner and have the uncertainty of not knowing if I have a home for my children and I because the two companies cant get it together for the sake of the consumer. I want my county to be sent the proper documentation to put the recording on file that is necessary. I want my credit bureaus to be made aware that I have been paying my modification amount on time since XX/XX/XXXX. I know what its like to be XXXX  when I was a child and as a result, I had to grow up in XXXX XXXX. I purchase this home to give me and my children a sense of stability and consistency and this fear of losing my home is traumatic for me!!! Thank you for taking the time to review my complaint.\",\n",

I received a message stating to call them which I did. The customer service representative only asked me my phone number and then told me I had to wait 7-10 days ( which was fine ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another email from them stating I was declined because they could not verify my identity. They did not mention any usage of my XXXX credit report, nor did they do their due diligence of asking me to submit ID verification documents like any other financial institute would do. I sitll have not received the hard letter copy. After reviewing my credit reports, I updated my address and phone number and applied for another synchrony credit card ( WALMART ). Again, same message to call. Again, only asked for phone number. After googling I found out they use your phone number to verify your identity so good luck if you have a new number like me. \\nI want them to either remove the hard inquiries from my credit report or let me send in sufficient documentation to verify my identity.',\n",

Unbeknownst to me, the representative I had spoken to reversed my entire XXXX mortgage payment instead of just crediting me the {$7.00} that was erroneously taken out of my checking account. Upon attending our closing, and our title closer speaking with the representative from XXXX XXXX and receiving the closing figures, we successfully concluded our closing thinking everything was fine. A month later I received a notice from XXXX XXXX advising we were in arrears in our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX explaining that we had closed that account on XX/XX/18. They advised that they indeed saw the money for the pay-off of the mortgage however it was being held in a suspense account pending further investigation. I told them to expeditiously examine the issue and get back to me asap. After not hearing from them for over a week, I called the servicing center and spoke to an agent that informed me I owed them {$2000.00} for XXXX mortgage payment. I said that was incorrect as I was enrolled in EFT which automatically pays my mortgage. I was then apprised with the fact that XXXX XXXX had reversed the entire mortgage payment for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX instead of crediting me the {$7.00} I had requested. I told them at no time was I EVER made aware that the entire XXXX payment was being reversed as I would not have allowed that to happen. They told me they would \" look into this \\'\\'. I also advised them that THEIR AGENT gave the figures at the closing on XX/XX/XXXX which indicated that XXXX XXXX knew the payment was reversed and should have included that in the closing numbers. I then went back and forth with XXXX XXXX for several weeks regarding this disaster speaking with agent after agent and vehemently demanded that no action be taken with any credit agency until AFTER a full investigation of the issue was resolved as this was surely the fault of XXXX XXXX. I was assured by a supervisor at XXXX XXXX that indeed no action would be taken. In XXXX, I was notified by the credit agencies that our credit score had dropped over 200 points due to late payments on our mortgage! I again contacted XXXX XXXX demanding they reverse this negative report only to be told they can not. I am sure you know that a negative report against a mortgage is a killer to your credit. I have not been contacted by XXXX XXXX and am pleading for help with this company that has the absolute worst reputation in the industry.',\n",

This complaint involves the following GR employees XXXX XXXX ( VP of Mortgage Lending ) ( \" XXXX \\'\\' ), XXXX XXXX ( Loan Coordinator ) ( \" XXXX \\'\\' ), and XXXX XXXX ( \" XXXX \\'\\' ) ( Production Manager ). \\n\\nAfter a number of other mishaps during the pre-closing process, we were first told that XXXX finally submitted our application to the real lender this past Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). We were scheduled to close today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite assuring us on Friday that we were \" on track \\'\\' to close on time, XXXX and XXXX failed to disclose of mistakes delaying our close. They then failed to answer direct questions -- on Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday -- about when documents were sent so that we could evaluated whether closing needed to be moved and seek and extension from the sellers. Finally, at XXXX Wednesday XXXX -- hours before we were scheduled to close -- XXXX told me via a phone call that XXXX had mistakenly sent documentation to XXXX rather than the investor, XXXX XXXX, and that it lead to the delay. She then promised to provide me details in writing by the next morning so that I could assuage the sellers \\' concerns and obtain an extension. \\n\\nOn Thursday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a call from XXXX informing me that the information provided by XXXX -- which I had shared with the sellers as we tried to work towards delaying the closing at the last minute -- was incorrect. In fact, no information had been sent to XXXX. Rather, when the XXXX XXXX underwriter had returned the file to GR on XX/XX/XXXX, it had done so with a direction that the property appraisal be sent to collateral underwriting. GR ignored that direction until it finally sent the appraisal over to collateral review on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. This was not disclosed to us until my call with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. \\n\\nOn that same call, XXXX assured me that there would only be a 3-4 hour turnaround once approval from XXXX XXXX was received because our filed would be in \" rush \\'\\' protocol for GR. Coincidentally, XXXX XXXX sent over approval by collateral review just after our call, around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX left me a voicemail that afternoon indicating they had received approval and would \" work on a closing for tomorrow on a rush. \\'\\' Despite those promises, as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the file is still \" in line \\'\\' to be reviewed by underwriting. The sellers are now threatening not to extend the contract. XXXX is backtracking on his promises yesterday, saying in a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX e-mail to me that \" I never once said we were closing today. \\'\\' GR is refusing to take accountability, refusing to fix the problem, and refusing to make amends for their errors.',\n",

In XXXX of XXXX, I was notified by Experian that I was being given another free year of monitoring due to the breach but that I needed to renew through an online sign up. I signed up online and was required to provide credit card information to complete the registration. I did not select any paid service but began seeing a {$19.00} charge on my next monthly credit card statement. I cancelled this service, which in and of itself was very challenging and beyond what I would say a reasonable person would expect to go through to cancel and received a cancellation email on XX/XX/XXXX. I continued seeing charges each and every month after that. I signed onto the Experian website today after seeing two charges for {$19.00}, one on XX/XX/XXXX and another on XX/XX/XXXX, both in year current. Again, I navigated my way through an impossibly vague process of cancelling my membership and received another confirmation email dated today, XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Experian by phone to confirm it was cancelled but the number they provided said they will only take cancellation requests online. I chatted a representative to confirm my paid membership was cancelled and he/she said it was but not until XX/XX/XXXX. I asked the chat agent to refund me the 3x charges that were made to my account and he/she said they can not due to their policies. I asked why I was being charged in XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX when I have an email confirming I cancelled in XXXX of XXXX, the agent would not answer my question and just said they don't do refunds. I informed the agent that what they are doing is engaging in an unfair deceptive act or practice that makes cancelling unreasonably difficult if not impossible when paid membership fees just begin billing for no reason. I told them I would be reporting their unfair deceptive act or practice to the CFPB and asked that the agent also forward it to their internal complaint department.\",\n",

Not only did they not do so, but they claimed that the account belonged to a company called XXXX XXXX. I wrote XXXX XXXX back letting them know that the account is NOT being reported by XXXX XXXX. It is being reported by XXXX XXXX, meaning the following. If XXXX XXXX is admitting that they do not own the account, they do not legally have the right to report anything regarding the account on my credit!

We explained to XXXX that we were interested in viewing their XXXX home but was NOT looking to purchase until XX/XX/2018 because we were working on paying down our credit card balances. After viewing the home, XXXX was adamant that we should allow him to do a soft internal pull of our credit score so that he could show us the accounts that we should focus on paying down. We agreed under the conditions that it was a soft, internal pull that would NOT affect our credit. To our surprise, it not only resulted in a hard pull but our information was also sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX  without our consent. As illustrated by the email communications, I was unsuccessfully in resolving this issue as well as explaining my concerns to the Owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I was trying to get him to see that the information that XXXX communicated to us was clearly misleading and dishonest because otherwise, I wouldnt be upset if I came there with the intentions to buy. However, I was only looking and obtaining information to better prepare for my home-buying experience in the months to come. Please note that I never contacted XXXX XXXX to obtain any information regarding the status of the loan application-that information remains unknown.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'In addition to my TEACH Grants being wrongfully converted to loans in XXXX of XXXX, my loans have now been turned over to the US Department of Education for default. I am NOT in default. According to the most recent escalated rep that I spoke with on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were put in default on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of an error on their behalf. As XXXX, an escalated rep in the XXXX XXXX explained, the method by which they refunded money to me for payments made to grants, threw my loans into default. As she explained on XX/XX/XXXX, this is \" A big mess \\'\\', and it is by no fault of yours. \\'\\' I understand that the loans now must go to the \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' and there is no timeline for the \" mess \\'\\' to be corrected. Meanwhile, my credit is trashed, and there is no estimated timeline that can be provided to me for the correction to occur. \\nThe numerous reps that I have spoken with since XXXX regarding my grants, Income-driven payment request, and public loan forgiveness program, have all given me contradictory information, and I have no faith in anyone I speak with there regarding my status on any of the above listed processes. For example, in XXXX, I had an escalated rep guide me through the Income-driven repayment application, wait on the phone until I completed the application, and uploaded to my online account. The next time I spoke with them regarding my expected refund for grant payments, I was told that the refund would not be issued, and that the payments would be credited to the overall loan amount. Yet, I was told in XXXX that I would be receiving a check by XX/XX/XXXX. During that same conversation, I took the opportunity to explain how I was exhausted from having to make numerous calls that usually exceeded 40 minutes, only to have to start over explaining the issues and repeating what I had been told on the previous conversation. Consistently, I was told that I was given incorrect information by previous rep. If it were not the truth, and if it did not cause stress, it would be comical - like a XXXX XXXX XXXX skit. Every rep provided different information regarding the same topic, even among escalated reps ( that I demanded to deal with every call since XXXX ). I complained about how it took 45 minutes and an escalated rep to teach me how to complete my IDR request so that I was not overcharged, and how upset I was that I had paid excessive payments for years because the application did not allow for me to correctly document my financial situation. In other words, I told the rep that the application \" baits \\'\\' you in to documenting income and spouse information that is not correct, but you are scared not to document it like that because of the liability you are subject to for filing false information. I told him how thankful I was that 5 years in to filing IDRs and making payments, someone was competent enough, and cared enough, to guide me through the application to get payment lowered where it should be. When I described that situation, the representative said that my IDR request provided \" false \\'\\' information, and that it could get me in trouble! I explained again that an escalated rep walked me through it, and waited on the phone for me to upload it and it be received. He said he can see where that happened, but unfortunately the rep gave me incorrect information. He said I could keep the payment where it is for now, but that I would have to file it differently if my husband and I file taxes jointly. \\nThere are many more occasions in which I have been provided false information and guidance, including information regarding the XXXX program. Obviously, Fed Loan Servicing reps have no accountability, and/or competence regarding protocols in any department. I have managed to get through, and have coped with the undue stress and excessive time and aggravation involved in managing my student loans, but default, I can not deal with! This is unbearable, and is negatively affecting my health. I am seeking legal advice. Thankfully, I have documented my calls since XXXX, with employee ID numbers. \\nI am a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have worked at the same school, in the same position for 10 years. I pay my bills and am a law abiding citizen. Please advise.',\n",

I am wondering why this associate could not suggest another Capital One card that does not have an annual fee. I asked if there was another card that Capital One can offer which does not carry the late fee. The associate finally did provide a solution to transition into Venture One card which does not carry an annual fee.

Please refer to previous complaint above. My information was lost/mixed up with another person. They asked me if there another person with my last name with the same social security number. I called Friday XX/XX/2019 to get my issue resolved and was given 5 business days. I called XX/XX/XXXX and they extended it for another 5 business days. After my previous complaint, everything on my account was duplicated. So for a few days I at least had a credit score, though everything was wrong. Student debt, loans, etc. I called a lady to get it fixed ( it was pretty straight forward ) because the loan numbers and account # s were the exact same. What then happened was that everything got deleted again and went from a XXXX to a XXXX again. Then to make it worse, I was asked to call my bank to make sure they are reporting correctly and inserted it on my account ... again pointing me back to blame the bank. If you read the previous complaint, they were able to find my information without using my social security number, but again, we have to wait longer to see what turns up. This problem hasn't been fixed one bit and am worried about privacy at this point too.\",\n",

I am sending this letter as of my final attempt to fairly allow you to do your job and kindly remove the errors that are reporting on my credit report. I've mentioned that i am a victim of identity theft. My information was also leaked in several breaches over the years but a recent one a few weeks in XXXX of 2019.

All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq.

Again, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is the crooked company who stole my family 's home at the auction, and is paying BIG money to Attorney XXXX XXXX # XXXX to continuously harass my family and me by sending us threatening letters, and phone calls attempting to steal our home and throw us out into the street. Of course this was at the direction of Wells Fargo. Had my magnificent Mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the account holder had been alive, she would have been XXXX years old on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. Wells Fargo, was continuously harassing my Mother when she was alive, threatening her with notices, which increased her stress level, causing her to become ill and unfortunately passed away a few years ago. My Mother had a lawsuit in place against Wells Fargo for unfairly taking advantage of her as a senior, and practicing predatory lending practices against her. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo was trying to throw my XXXX year old Mother into the street. Go figure ... Presently, Wells Fargo has teamed up with several of their cohorts to attempt to destroy our families dream. Quite naturally, this TRILLION dollar company is steadily denying any wrongdoing whatsoever. This is how Wells Fargo has managed to become a trillion dollar predatory lender due to the fact that this horrific company has attempted to steal the dreams of middle class families illegally, committing fraud for many years forcing middle class families out of the homes, which is why the former CEO of Wells Fargo, whose name is XXXX XXXX XXXX has be forced to step down by Congresswoman XXXX XXXX. It appears, however, that the general counsel who has interimly taken over as CEO, XXXX XXXX XXXX, appears to be just as crooked as XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to be shut down, and many other class action lawsuits should be filed repeatedly, and dismantle this TRILLION dollar corrupt lender, until they file bankruptcy, which I am positive will be transpiring very soon. I will have the editors of prominent newspapers, and the eyewitness news to broadcast how the corrupt attorneys who are on Wells Fargo 's payroll AKA XXXX XXXX, and the infamous attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, # XXXX in Cahoots with XXXX XXXX XXXXd XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who actually conducted the illegal sale of our home, and others. Wells Fargo, you need to surrender, and give my family and opportunity to stay in our Mother 's home, and not attempt to steal our family 's legacy ... .Wells Fargo XXXX al., Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, how can you sleep at night, knowing that you are destroying and dismantling families all over this state and the nation?\",\n",

When we went back to court they said they would send me statement of fraud forms to fill out which asked me to write my name out 5 times. I have been a victim of fraud several times. The instances have included, but not limited to, social security numbers and taxes on two different occasions and most recently someone attempting to forward a debit card belonging to me to Florida. In no way am I comfortable sending several copies of my signature to a company whose business it is to unscrupulously collect debt from consumers. This is against the law because it is the plaintiff \\'s burden to validate debt. The court is not enforcing this and they both have the upper hand because they know the law and I do not. It is my opinion that the court and the credit collector are using fear and intimidation tactics to unlawfully gain money knowing that I am a layman in matters of law. Stenger and Stenger are refusing to validate the debt and instead hoping that I will concede out of fear or be made to pay by the court because I have no way of disproving their claims.',\n",

       "  'complaint_what_happened': 'I pulled all 3 of my major credit reports to find out what was showing on them, as I hadn\\'t done it in a long time. I was shocked to see accounts that I do not recognize, including companies I\\'ve never done business with. One of these was : I.Q. DATA INTERNATIONAL, INC. The address LISTED ON the credit report is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX. I was advised by my legal counsel to send a \" Validation \\'\\' Letter to them to validate the debt under the FDCPA and FCRA. I have attached the letter with my complaint. I have also attached the information that they sent back to me. I have never done any business with this company, and they failed to send me ANY kind of validation such as a signed contract with them. All they sent was a screenshot of an itemized list of charges of which I do not recognize and didn\\'t even contain dates or anything on it. I also sent a dispute letter to all 3 credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ), and I.Q. Data International has NOT removed this erroneous account from my credit reports, or have sent me any kind of real validation such as a signed contract with their company. I request for this company to remove this account from my credit reports immediately, as they have not followed the law, have reported inaccurate information on our credit reports, including FDCPA Section 809 ( b ), which carries a {$1000.00} fine for not validating the debt and still continuing to report it on my credit reports. Thank you for helping me resolve this matter.',\n",

The order was placed by phone and early cancel fee not disclosed. DIVERSIFIED CONSULTANTS needed to provide evidence. This is a bad faith action and a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

       "  'complaint_what_happened': \"GM Financial 's website for billing has been reporting incorrectly for the almost 3 years I have leased a car. It continually shows the wrong amount due and incorrect due dates. Example : Login to the webpage it shows amount due as {$310.00} then look at the electronic statement and it shows {$290.00}. Consumers would be unsure as to what amount is actually due. Now at the end of the lease it shows {$750.00} due and no statement for XX/XX/XXXX. I called and they said I only owe {$140.00} ( which I paid ). I do not trust this company at all and I'm sure there will be more charges even though they tell me this XXXX 's out my account. This is very confusing and I have been very diligent to pay attention to statement amounts instead of the website but I'm worried that others would incur late payments and other financial hardships based on misinformation. This is very bad business. When I asked about this several times the only answer I got was they are working on it or they don't know why it shows this. I have talked to other GM financial customers who have similar stories. This needs to be investigated for predatory lending practices. I work for a large financial institution and if we did business like this we would be in trouble.\",\n",

After that, they would make disrespectful, harassing and occasionally threatening calls to myself and my cosigner, who was in the hospital during one of  these calls. While I understand that they are a business, these calls came when I was only two days late in payment, and when I had already called XXXX XXXX and informed them that I was waiting on a paycheck and then they would get their money.

I had to have a car. I was in shock but not stupid. I did not sign a lease with a blank space, but that is the copy they gave me. I have paid {$320.00} on a {$310.00} loan for years. I knew it would cut off a large amount but I have two payments left ( one on XX/XX/XXXX ) and another I am not sure when ( XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/2019 ). I requested a copy of the payments. The copy is wrong. I have had multiple problems with this 6 year overpriced loan on a base XXXX XXXX -- I think it may have been wrecked and fixed and sold as new. The bluetooth didn't work for 8 months until it was replaced. I complained each time I had my oil changed. I couldn't get a title when I moved back to Texas   from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The service departments in two states at various places in both states have treated me badly, even at the place I bought it near my hometown where I was visiting my mother when my car was totaled. Two dealerships in Texas didn't change the oil when I paid them after it turned 100,000 ; the first per a XXXX mechanic. At 120,000 it is burning oil even though it has been changed before time, and often at 3-4000 miles. It has been well taken care of, or at least I have paid to have it well-taken care of at the dealership. How do I get an audit of my account at XXXX? It is wrong. The sheets I have from them prove that.\",\n",
