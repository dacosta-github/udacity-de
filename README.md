# Data Engineering Nanodegree
Projects of Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree.

## Projects

### Data Modeling
In this project, I’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. I’ll create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL I will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into new tables.
