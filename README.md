## Projects

### Data Modeling
In this course, I’ll learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. I’ll understand the differences between different data models, and how to choose the appropriate data model for a given situation. I’ll also build fluency in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

**Course Project 1**  - [Data Modeling with Postgres](https://github.com/dacosta-github/udacity-de/tree/main/postgres-data-modeling)

In this project, I’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. I’ll create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL I will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into new tables.

**Course Project 2**  - [Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/dacosta-github/udacity-de/tree/main/apache-cassandra-data-modeling)

In these projects, I’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. I'll create a database and ETL pipeline, in both Postgres and Apache Cassandra, designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. For PostgreSQL, I will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into new tables. For Apache Cassandra, I'll model data so I can run specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.
